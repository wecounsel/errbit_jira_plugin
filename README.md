# ErrbitJiraPlugin

This gem adds support for JIRA to Errbit.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'errbit_jira_plugin'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install errbit_jira_plugin

## Usage

You will need to generate an API token for use with the account you connect to JIRA. You can learn about these tokens on [this confluence page](https://confluence.atlassian.com/cloud/api-tokens-938839638.html), which will link directly to the API token creator [here](https://id.atlassian.com/manage/api-tokens). It may be prudent to create a dummy users on JIRA and use it's API token rather than any one person's personal API token.
